    "The first two lists are each contain all of the integers from 100 to 999 inclusive, and palin_pair is the list where the numbers that create the largest palindrome will be store. The function is_palin, checks to see if a number is a palindrome. Palin_num, initialized to 0, holds the count of opposite characters that are equal. Num_len is eqaul to the length of the number fed in minus one, because strings start at index 0. The for loop checks whether the characters at either end are equal. If they are equal, then palin_num is incremented by one. If the number is a palindrome, then each pair will be equal and palin_num will be equal to the lower limit of half of the length of the number. If those two are equal the function will return true, indicating the number is a palindrome. Otherwise the function will return false. The next for loop goes through each value in the first list. The next for loop multiplies num1 by everynumber is the second list (list2). If the product of those two number (prod) is a palindrome (checked with the is_palin function) AND the product is also larger than the existing largest palindrome that is stored in palin_pair, then palin_pair is replaced with num1 and num2.

    "I began by initializing the compressed string to be nothing, and the letter count to be 1. The for loop runs through each character in the string, from index 0, to the last index which is 1 minus the length since the indexing begins at 0. The for loop determines whether the character following the current character is the equal to the current character. If they are equal the letter count is incremented and the for loop goes on to the next character. If they are not equal, then the character and the curret letter count are added onto the compressed string, and letter count is set to 1 to start counting the next group of characters. The next portion deals with the last character, since it is not addressed in the preceeding for loop. If the last character is the same as the second to last character, the character is added on to the string as well as the letter count, which should remain accurate from the previous for loop. If they are not equal then the last character and the number 1 are added to the end of the compressed string Finally the function returns the compressed string if it is shorter than the original string. If not, it returns the original string. My code is case sensitive, in order to make the function non-case sensitive at the begining of the function one would put string.lower(), to make the entire string lowercase, and case sensitivity would not longer be an issue."
